# statistics_for_social_sciences

Problem Statement:

Statistics is a tool used by almost everybody practicing sciences and social studies at various levels. According to students at UG and PG level in a local survey (that I conducted online), choosing statistical tools and conducting necessary tests on their data available is the biggest challenge they face. Blindly inserting data for random popular statistical tests like t-test and F-test often yields incorrect statistical test values and hence makes oneâ€™s study unreliable and vague conclusions are drawn based on that.


Proposal:

I propose a Website: Statistics for Social Sciences, aimed to help people with no statistical background choose and conduct relevant statistical tests for their data. The website will not only guide them with their data, but also consult them to better understand the mathematics and logic behind the output values. I am planning to build this product on R (using Shiny), which is a popularly used FLOSS. Hence, this product would discourage piracy of paid software like SPSS and STATA and let every researcher analyse their data without necessary knowledge of R (or any other language).

About this repository:

1. The folder named "html_frontend" contains all the files of the basic frontend built for the actual website.
2. The rest of the folders contain the source codes for respective statistical calculators (tools) built on R. These are the Shiny apps that are hosted for free on "shinyapps.io".
